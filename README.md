# Swifter
Analyze your 100m dash or running posture
To run the code you also need to get the yolov3.weights file and other files for the skeleton

Enter this into the terminal of the IDE you are using (example: if you are using VS Code, just copy and paste and enter this into the terminal at the bottom and the code should run)
python hackTJ.py --FPS (fps of the video) --File (put your video file name here) --height (your height)

It will create 3 different files for one image: the image, identification of image, and skeleton of the image
Make sure you are clearly visible in the video and not too small
Disclaimer: probably will not work for a full 100m dash since you will probably be too small for skeleton to detect you
